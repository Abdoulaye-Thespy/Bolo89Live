      <h2>Grid: A Powerful Tool for Web Layout Design</h2>
      <p>In the world of web design, creating visually appealing and well-structured layouts is crucial. One effective 
        tool that has revolutionized the way websites are designed is the CSS grid. With its flexible and intuitive nature,
         the grid system provides designers with a powerful framework for arranging and organizing web page elements. 
         In this article, we will introduce the basics of grid and explore its importance along with some demonstrations.
         <br>
         
         CSS grid is a layout system that allows designers to create complex web page structures by dividing the layout
         into rows and columns. It provides a two-dimensional grid that enables precise control over the placement and 
         alignment of elements within a container. Also, it lets you create a grid-based structure for your web page, 
         making it easier to achieve responsive designs.

         <h3>Why is grid important?</h3>
         <br>
         <ul>
          <li>
            One of the key benefits of using a grid system is its ability to create responsive layouts. Grids provide a 
            flexible structure that automatically adapts to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring consistent and
             visually appealing designs across various platforms.</li>
             <br>

             <li>Grids help maintain consistency in design by providing a systematic framework. With grid-based layouts,
              designers can organize content elements in a harmonious and structured manner, making it easier for users 
              to navigate and understand the website's information hierarchy.</li>
              <br>

              <li> Designers can easily align and position elements on the grid, reducing the time spent on manual 
                adjustments. This efficiency allows designers to focus more on creativity and refining the overall user 
                experience.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Grids offer flexibility in terms of layout variations. Designers can experiment with different grid 
                  configurations to create unique and engaging designs.</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Some examples where grid is commonly used</h3>
         <br>
         <ul>
          <li>Grids are commonly used in magazine-style designs where content is presented in a grid-like structure. 
            This allows for easy placement of articles, images, and other elements in a visually pleasing manner.</li>
            <br>

            <li>Grids provide an excellent foundation for creating portfolio websites. Designers can use the grid system
               to showcase their work in a clean and organized manner, making it easier for visitors to navigate through
                different projects.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Grids are ideal for displaying product listings in e-commerce websites. By using a grid, designers
                   can arrange product images, titles, prices, and other details in a consistent and visually appealing 
                   manner, enhancing the overall shopping experience.</li>
                   <br>

                   <li>Also, think of a webpage and how there's usually a navigation bar, a sidebar, and the content in 
                    the middle. A CSS Grid helps achieve that sort of styling easily by dividing up the page into 
                    different sections where each element can take place in the specified section.</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>key aspects of the grid concept </h2>
      </p>

      <p><bold class="grid-bold">Grid Container:</bold>
        In CSS Grid, a grid container is the parent element that contains a grid layout. It is defined using the 
        <span class="grid-span"> display: grid or display: inline-grid property </span> on the container element. Once a container element
         is defined as a grid container, you can use a variety of properties to control the layout of the grid.
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="assets/img/blogs/first-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

      </p>
      <br>

      <p><bold class="grid-bold">Grid item: </bold>
        The child elements of the grid container that are placed into the grid. Grid items are positioned using 
        grid lines, which are defined by the grid tracks.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="assets/img/blogs/second-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

      </p>
      <br>

      <p><bold class="grid-bold">Grid line: </bold>
        A line that divides the grid into rows or columns. Grid lines are numbered from 1 to n, where n is the number 
        of rows or columns in the grid.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="assets/img/blogs/third-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><bold class="grid-bold">Grid track: </bold>
        The space between two adjacent grid lines. Grid tracks can be sized using the 
       <span class="grid-span"> grid-template-columns </span>  and <span class="grid-span"> grid-template-rows properties.</span> The space between
        two-row lines is referred to as the row tracks and The space between two-column lines is referred to as the column tracks. A size is 
        assigned to these tracks whenever a grid is created.
        <br>
        <br>

      </p>
      <br>

      <p><bold class="grid-bold">  Grid cell: </bold>
        The intersection of a row and a column in the grid. Grid cells can contain grid items or be empty.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="assets/img/blogs/fifth-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

      </p>
      <br>

      <p><bold class="grid-bold">Grid area:</bold>
        A rectangular area of the grid that can contain one or more grid cells. Grid areas are defined using 
        the <span class="grid-span">grid-template-areas property.</span>
        <br>
        <br>

      </p>
      <br>

      <h2> CSS Grid Properties </h2>
      
      <p>There are two main types of CSS Grid properties namely:
        <br>

        <bold class="grid-bold">Parent properties (Grid Container)</bold>  and <bold class="grid-bold">Child Properties (Grid Items).</bold>

        <h4> Parent properties (Grid Container) </h4>
        Grid Container properties are used to define the layout of the grid container itself. These properties are 
        applied to the parent element that contains the grid items. Some examples are:
        </p>
         
        <ul>

          <li> <bold class="grid-bold"> - Display:</bold> The display property is used to define the container element as a 
            grid container. To use the display with CSS Grid, set the value to grid. This will turn the container element into a grid 
            container, allowing you to use other grid properties to define the grid layout. </li>
            <br>

            <li> <bold class="grid-bold">- grid-template-columns & grid-template-rows: </bold> grid-template-columns and 
              grid-template-rows are used to define the size and position of columns and rows in a CSS grid. These properties 
              allow you to create a flexible and responsive grid layout that can adjust 
              to different screen sizes and content.
              <br>
              <br>
              <img src="assets/img/blogs/seventh-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
              <br>

              the values represent the track size, and the space between them is the grid line. We can then place elements inside the grid by using 
              the grid-column and grid-row properties.</li>
              <br>
              <li><bold class="grid-bold">- grid-template-areas: </bold> grid-template-areas allows you to define the layout of a grid by assigning 
                names to areas within the grid. These names are used in the grid-area property to place items within the grid.
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="assets/img/blogs/eight-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

              </li>
              <br>

              <li> <bold  class="grid-bold">- grid-template: </bold> grid-template is a shorthand property in CSS Grid that allows 
                you to define both the number and size of grid columns and rows in one declaration.
                
             </li>
             <br>

             <li> <bold  class="grid-bold"> -  column-gap, row-gap </bold> column-gap and row-gap define the space between columns and rows, respectively.
              We have a grid container with three columns and two rows.
              <br>
              <br>
              <img src="assets/img/blogs/nineth-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

             </li>
             <br>

             <li><bold  class="grid-bold"> -grid-gap </bold> grid-gap is a shorthand property in CSS grid layout that allows you 
              to specify the gap between grid columns and rows at the same time.
              <br>
              <br>
              <img src="assets/img/blogs/ninth-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

            </li>
              <br>

              <li><bold  class="grid-bold"> - justify-items </bold> justify-items is a CSS Grid property that defines how the 
                grid items are aligned along the main axis (the horizontal axis) within their grid container. It is used to 
                control the positioning of items in the grid container when there is extra space available in the main-axis direction.
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="assets/img/blogs/tenth-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

                 <br>
                Here are the possible values for justify-items in CSS Grid:
                <br>
                <bold  class="grid-bold">- stretch (default):</bold> This value stretches the grid items to fill the 
                available space along the main-axis.
                <br>
                <bold  class="grid-bold"> - start: </bold>This value aligns the grid items along the start edge of the grid 
                container in the main-axis direction.
                <br>
                <bold  class="grid-bold"> - end:</bold> This value aligns the grid items along the end edge of the 
                grid container in the main-axis direction.
                <br>
                <bold  class="grid-bold"> - center:</bold> This value centers the grid items along the main axis of the 
                grid container.
                <br>
              </li>
              <br>

              <li><bold  class="grid-bold"> - align-items </bold> align-items defines how the grid items are aligned along the cross-axis (the vertical axis) within 
                their grid container. It is used to control the positioning of items in the grid container when there is extra space available in
                 the cross-axis direction.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <img src="assets/img/blogs/eleven-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

                  Here are the possible values for align-items in CSS Grid:
                 <br>
                 <bold  class="grid-bold"> -stretch (default):</bold> This value stretches the grid items to fill the available space along the cross-axis.
                 <br>
                 <bold  class="grid-bold">-start: </bold> This value aligns the grid items along the start edge of the grid container in the cross-axis direction.
                 <br>
                 <bold  class="grid-bold">- end: </bold> This value aligns the grid items along the end edge of the grid container in the cross-axis direction.

                  <bold  class="grid-bold">-center: </bold>  This value centers the grid items along the cross-axis of the grid container.
                </li>
                <br>

                <li><bold class="grid-bold">-place-items</bold> 
                  place-items is a shorthand CSS Grid property that combines the align-items and justify-items properties into a single declaration. 
                  It is used to set both the horizontal and vertical alignment of grid items within their grid container.
                    The possible value for place-items in CSS Grid is:
                    <span class="grid-span"> <align-items> <justify-items>:</span> This value specifies the alignment for the vertical
                      and horizontal axes respectively. You can use any 
                      of the possible values for align-items and justify-items to set the alignment for each axis.</li>
                      <br>

                      <li><bold class="grid-bold">- justify-content</bold>
                        justify-content defines how the grid items are aligned along the main axis (the horizontal axis) within their grid container. It is used to control the positioning of the grid container along the main axis when extra space is available in that direction.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                    <br>

                    <li><bold class="grid-bold">- align-content </bold> align-content is a CSS Grid property that defines how the grid items are aligned along the 
                      cross-axis (the vertical axis) within their grid container. It is used to control the positioning of the grid container 
                      itself along the cross-axis when there is extra space available in that direction.
                      <br>

                      Here are the possible values for align-content in CSS Grid:
                      <br>
                      <bold class="grid-bold">  - stretch (default):</bold> stretches the grid items to fill the available space along the cross-axis.
                       <br>
                       <bold class="grid-bold"> - start:</bold> aligns the grid container along the start edge of the cross-axis.
                       <br>
                       <bold class="grid-bold">  - end:</bold> aligns the grid container along the end edge of the cross-axis.
                       <br>
                       <bold class="grid-bold">  - center:</bold> centers the grid container along the cross-axis.
                       <br>
                       <bold class="grid-bold">  - space-between:</bold> evenly distributes the grid items along the cross-axis, with the first item at 
                       the start edge and the last item at the end edge.
                       <br>
                       <bold class="grid-bold">  - space-around:</bold> evenly distributes the grid items along the 
                       cross-axis, with equal space between each item and half that space at the start and end edges.
                       <br>
                       <bold class="grid-bold"> - space-evenly:</bold> evenly distributes the grid items along the cross-axis, with equal space between each item and at the 
                       start and end edges.
                       <br>
                       <bold class="grid-bold"> -place-content</bold>
                       The place-content property in CSS grid allows you to align and justify grid items along both the horizontal and vertical axes.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><bold class="grid-bold"> - grid-auto-columns & grid-auto-rows</bold>grid-auto-columns and grid-auto-rows are properties that allow you to define the
                      size of rows and columns that are created automatically to fill the grid container. These properties come into play when there 
                      are more grid items than cells in the explicit grid, which means that some cells are created automatically to accommodate the 
                      additional items.
                      <br>
                      <br>

                    </li>
                      <br>

                      <li><bold class="grid-bold"> -grid-auto-flow</bold>It specifies how the grid container should automatically place grid items that don't have a 
                        specific grid position set.The possible values for grid-auto-flow are
                        <br>
                        <bold>- row:</boldd> This is the default value, and it means that the auto-placement algorithm should place items in rows, 
                          filling up each row before moving on to the next one.
                          <br>
                          <bold class="grid-bold"> - column:</bold> This value specifies that the auto-placement algorithm should place items in columns, 
                          filling up each column before moving on to the next one.
                          <br>
                          <bold class="grid-bold" > - dense:</bold> This value tells the auto-placement algorithm to try to fill in any empty cells as it goes along, 
                            rather than leaving them empty and moving on to the next row or column. This can result in items being placed in unexpected 
                            locations, but it can also help to fill the grid more efficiently.
                            <br>
                            <bold class="grid-bold"> -grid</bold>
                            The grid property is the shorthand for setting all of the below properties in a single declaration.

      <h4> Child Properties (Grid Items) </h4>

      <p>
        Child properties are the CSS properties applied to the individual child elements of grid items. They are: grid-column-start, 
        grid-column-end, grid-row-start, and grid-row-end, Grid-column and grid-row, grid-area, justify-self, align-self, and place-self
        <br>
        <br>

        <bold class="grid-bold"> grid-column-start, grid-column-end, grid-row-start & grid-row-end</bold>
        <br>
        The properties grid-column-start, grid-column-end, grid-row-start, and grid-row-end are used to specify the location of a grid item 
        within the grid container.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="assets/img/blogs/fifthteen-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

        <br>
        The grid-column-start and grid-column-end properties are used to specify the start and end positions of the grid item along the
         horizontal axis (columns). For example, the grid-column-start value of 1 and grid-column-end value of 3 for the .item-1 class 
         specifies that the grid item should start at column 1 and end at column 3. Similarly, the grid-row-start and grid-row-end properties 
         are used to specify the start and end positions of the grid item along the vertical axis (rows). For example, the grid-row-start 
         value of 1 and grid-row-end value of 2 for the .item-1 class specifies that the grid item should start at row 1 and end at row 2.

         <br>
         <br>

         <bold class="grid-bold">  grid-column & grid-row: </bold>
         <br>
         The grid-column and grid-row properties specify a grid item's location within a grid container. When using these properties on a 
         child grid item, you can define the starting and ending grid lines on the horizontal (for grid-column) and vertical (for grid-row) 
         axes to determine the position and size of the item in the grid. You can adjust the values of grid-column and grid-row to position 
         your grid items as desired within the grid container.
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="assets/img/blogs/sixteen-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
         <br>

         <p>
         <bold class="grid-bold"> grid-area: </bold> 
         
         The grid-area property is used to assign a grid item to a named grid area, specified by the grid-template-areas property 
         on the parent container. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="assets/img/blogs/seventeen-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

         To use grid-area, you need to follow these steps:
         <br>
         <br>
         Define the grid layout on the parent container using the grid-template-areas, grid-template-rows, and grid-template-columns properties.
         <br>
         <br>
         Assign a name to each grid area using the grid-area property on the child items. The name should correspond to the name you 
         defined in the grid-template-areas property.
         <br>
         <br>
         Set the position and size of the grid item using the grid-row-start, grid-row-end, grid-column-start, and grid-column-end properties.
         <br>
         <br>
         image
         In this example, we have a container with a grid layout that defines three rows and two columns, and three named grid areas. 
         Each child item is assigned to a grid area using the grid-area property, and its position and size are set using the grid-row-start, 
         grid-row-end, grid-column-start, and grid-column-end properties.
         <br>
         </p>

          <p>
         <bold class="grid-bold"> justify-self, align-self & place-self: </bold> 
         The justify-self, align-self, and place-self properties are used to control the alignment and placement of grid items 
         within their grid cells. These properties are applied to individual grid items, rather than to the grid container as a whole.
         Here's a brief explanation of each property:
         <br>
         </p>
         
         <p>
         <bold class="grid-bold"> -justify-self:</bold> This property controls the horizontal alignment of a grid item 
         within its cell. It can take values like start, end, center, stretch, and auto.
          <br>
          </p>

          <p>
          <bold class="grid-bold"> -align-self:</bold> This property controls the vertical alignment of a grid item within its cell. It can take values like 
          start, end, center, stretch, and auto.
          <br>
          </p>

          <p>
          <bold class="grid-bold"> -place-self:</bold> This is a shorthand property that combines justify-self and align-self into a single declaration. 
          It takes two values, the first for horizontal alignment and the second for vertical alignment, separated by a space.
          <br>
          </p>

          <p>
          using display: flex, justify-content, and align-items. The justify-self, align-self, and place-self properties are then used
           to control the alignment of individual items within their cells. The first item is aligned to the start of its cell horizontally 
           using justify-self: start. The second item is aligned to the end of its cell vertically using align-self: end. The third item is 
           centered both horizontally and vertically using place-self: center stretch, which sets the horizontal alignment to center and the 
           vertical alignment to stretch.
      </p>

      <h4> Tricks while using CSS Grids</h4>
      <p>To create more flexible and maintainable CSS grids, you can use these tricks to simplify your code.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Use the repeat() function to simplify grid templates: example; Instead of this <span class="grid-span"> grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;</span>
        Use the repeat() function for cleaner code <span class="grid-span"> grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        -  Use auto-fit or auto-fill to create flexible grids: example; This grid will automatically create as many columns as will fit in the container
        <span class="grid-span"> grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr)); </span> .  This grid will always create 3 columns, and will fill any extra space 
        with empty cells <span class="grid-span"> grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        -  Use grid-gap to add spacing between grid items: example; This grid will have a 20px gap between grid items  
        <span class="grid-span"> grid-gap: 20px;</span>
         <br>
         <br>
         -  Use grid-template-areas to create named grid areas
         <br>
         <br>
         - Creating a responsive grid with media queries
         <br>
         <br>
         - Nesting grids for more complex layouts
         <br>
         <br>

         To conclude, it is important to understand the basic principles of grids and practice working with them. Start by experimenting 
         with simple grid structures and gradually explore more complex layouts. Familiarize yourself with CSS grid systems and frameworks 
         that provide ready-to-use grid structures, making it easier to implement grids in your designs. Remember, the grid concept is a 
         powerful tool that can greatly enhance your web design skills. Embrace its structure, experiment with different layouts, and enjoy 
         the creative possibilities it offers.

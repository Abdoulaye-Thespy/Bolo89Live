      <h2>Grid: A Powerful Tool for Web Layout Design</h2>
      <p>In the world of web design, creating visually appealing and well-structured layouts is crucial. One effective 
        tool that has revolutionized the way websites are designed is the CSS grid. With its flexible and intuitive nature,
         the grid system provides designers with a powerful framework for arranging and organizing web page elements. 
         In this article, we will introduce the basics of grid and explore its importance along with some demonstrations.
         <br>
         
         CSS grid is a layout system that allows designers to create complex web page structures by dividing the layout
         into rows and columns. It provides a two-dimensional grid that enables precise control over the placement and 
         alignment of elements within a container. Also, it lets you create a grid-based structure for your web page, 
         making it easier to achieve responsive designs.

         <h3>Why is grid important?</h3>
         <br>
         <ul>
          <li>
            One of the key benefits of using a grid system is its ability to create responsive layouts. Grids provide a 
            flexible structure that automatically adapts to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring consistent and
             visually appealing designs across various platforms.</li>

             <li>Grids help maintain consistency in design by providing a systematic framework. With grid-based layouts,
              designers can organize content elements in a harmonious and structured manner, making it easier for users 
              to navigate and understand the website's information hierarchy.</li>

              <li> Designers can easily align and position elements on the grid, reducing the time spent on manual 
                adjustments. This efficiency allows designers to focus more on creativity and refining the overall user 
                experience.</li>

                <li>Grids offer flexibility in terms of layout variations. Designers can experiment with different grid 
                  configurations to create unique and engaging designs.</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Some examples where grid is commonly used</h3>
         <br>
         <ul>
          <li>Grids are commonly used in magazine-style designs where content is presented in a grid-like structure. 
            This allows for easy placement of articles, images, and other elements in a visually pleasing manner.</li>

            <li>Grids provide an excellent foundation for creating portfolio websites. Designers can use the grid system
               to showcase their work in a clean and organized manner, making it easier for visitors to navigate through
                different projects.</li>

                <li>Grids are ideal for displaying product listings in e-commerce websites. By using a grid, designers
                   can arrange product images, titles, prices, and other details in a consistent and visually appealing 
                   manner, enhancing the overall shopping experience.</li>

                   <li>Also, think of a webpage and how there's usually a navigation bar, a sidebar, and the content in 
                    the middle. A CSS Grid helps achieve that sort of styling easily by dividing up the page into 
                    different sections where each element can take place in the specified section.</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>key aspects of the grid concept </h2>
         <br>
      </p>

      <p><bold>Grid Container:</bold>
        In CSS Grid, a grid container is the parent element that contains a grid layout. It is defined using the 
        <span> display: grid or display: inline-grid property </span> on the container element. Once a container element
         is defined as a grid container, you can use a variety of properties to control the layout of the grid.
      </p>

      <p><bold>Grid item: </bold>
        The child elements of the grid container that are placed into the grid. Grid items are positioned using 
        grid lines, which are defined by the grid tracks.

      </p>

      <p><bold>Grid line: </bold>
        A line that divides the grid into rows or columns. Grid lines are numbered from 1 to n, where n is the number 
        of rows or columns in the grid.

      </p>

      <p><bold>Grid track: </bold>
        The space between two adjacent grid lines. Grid tracks can be sized using the 
       <span> grid-template-columns </span>  and <span> grid-template-rows properties.</span> The space between two-row lines is referred to 
        as the row tracks and The space between two-column lines is referred to as the column tracks. A size is 
        assigned to these tracks whenever a grid is created.
      </p>

      <p><bold>  Grid cell: </bold>
        The intersection of a row and a column in the grid. Grid cells can contain grid items or be empty.

      </p>

      <p><bold>Grid area:</bold>
        A rectangular area of the grid that can contain one or more grid cells. Grid areas are defined using 
        the <span>grid-template-areas property.</span>
      </p>

      <h2> CSS Grid Properties </h2>
      <br>
      <p>There are two main types of CSS Grid properties namely:
        <bold>Parent properties (Grid Container)</bold>  and <bold>Child Properties (Grid Items).</bold>

        <h4> Parent properties (Grid Container) </h4>
        Grid Container properties are used to define the layout of the grid container itself. These properties are 
        applied to the parent element that contains the grid items. Some examples are:
        <br>
        <br>

        <bold> - Display:</bold> The display property is used to define the container element as a grid container. 
        To use the display with CSS Grid, set the value to grid. This will turn the container element into a grid 
        container, allowing you to use other grid properties to define the grid layout. 
        
      <br>
      <br>

      <bold>- grid-template-columns & grid-template-rows: </bold> grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows are used to define the size and 
      position of columns and rows in a CSS grid. These properties allow you to create a flexible and responsive grid layout that can adjust 
      to different screen sizes and content.
      the values represent the track size, and the space between them is the grid line. We can then place elements inside the grid by using 
      the grid-column and grid-row properties.

      <br>
      <br>

      <bold>- grid-template-areas: </bold> grid-template-areas allows you to define the layout of a grid by assigning 
      names to areas within the grid. These names are used in the grid-area property to place items within the grid.

      <br>
      <br>

      <bold>- grid-template: </bold> grid-template is a shorthand property in CSS Grid that allows you to define both the number and size 
      of grid columns and rows in one declaration.

      <br>
      <br>

      <bold> -  column-gap, row-gap </bold> column-gap and row-gap define the space between columns and rows, respectively.
      We have a grid container with three columns and two rows.

      <br>
      <br>

      <bold> -grid-gap </bold> grid-gap is a shorthand property in CSS grid layout that allows you to specify the gap between grid 
      columns and rows at the same time.

      <bold> - justify-items </bold> justify-items is a CSS Grid property that defines how the grid items are aligned along the main 
      axis (the horizontal axis) within their grid container. It is used to control the positioning of items in the grid container when
       there is extra space available in the main-axis direction.
       <br>
      Here are the possible values for justify-items in CSS Grid:
     
      <bold>- stretch (default):</bold> This value stretches the grid items to fill the available space along the main-axis.
      <bold> - start: </bold>This value aligns the grid items along the start edge of the grid container in the main-axis direction.
      <bold> - end:</bold> This value aligns the grid items along the end edge of the grid container in the main-axis direction.
      <bold> - center:</bold> This value centers the grid items along the main axis of the grid container.

      <bold> - align-items </bold> align-items defines how the grid items are aligned along the cross-axis (the vertical axis) within 
      their grid container. It is used to control the positioning of items in the grid container when there is extra space available in
       the cross-axis direction. Here are the possible values for align-items in CSS Grid:
       <br>

      <bold> -stretch (default):</bold> This value stretches the grid items to fill the available space along the cross-axis.
      <bold>-start: </bold> This value aligns the grid items along the start edge of the grid container in the cross-axis direction.
      <bold>- end: </bold> This value aligns the grid items along the end edge of the grid container in the cross-axis direction.
     <bold>-center: </bold>  This value centers the grid items along the cross-axis of the grid container.
     <br>

    <bold>-place-items</bold> 
     place-items is a shorthand CSS Grid property that combines the align-items and justify-items properties into a single declaration. 
     It is used to set both the horizontal and vertical alignment of grid items within their grid container.
      The possible value for place-items in CSS Grid is:
      <align-items> <justify-items>: This value specifies the alignment for the vertical and horizontal axes respectively. You can use any 
        of the possible values for align-items and justify-items to set the alignment for each axis.

        <bold>- justify-content</bold>
        justify-content defines how the grid items are aligned along the main axis (the horizontal axis) within their grid container. It is used to control the positioning of the grid container along the main axis when extra space is available in that direction.
        Here are the possible values for justify-content in CSS Grid:
        <br>
        <bold> - start (default):</bold> This value aligns the grid container along the start edge of the main axis.
       <bold> - end:</bold>  This value aligns the grid container along the end edge of the main axis.
       <bold>  - center:</bold> This value centers the grid container along the main axis.
        <bold> - space-between: </bold> This value evenly distributes the grid items along the main axis, with the first item at the start 
        edge and the last item at the end edge.
       <bold>  - space-around: </bold> This value evenly distributes the grid items along the main axis, with equal space between each item 
       and half that space at the start and end edges.
        <bold> - space-evenly:</bold> This value evenly distributes the grid items along the main axis, with equal space between each item 
        and at the start and end edges.

        <bold>- align-content </bold> align-content is a CSS Grid property that defines how the grid items are aligned along the 
        cross-axis (the vertical axis) within their grid container. It is used to control the positioning of the grid container 
        itself along the cross-axis when there is extra space available in that direction.
        Here are the possible values for align-content in CSS Grid:
        <br>
       <bold>  - stretch (default):</bold> stretches the grid items to fill the available space along the cross-axis.
        <bold> - start:</bold> aligns the grid container along the start edge of the cross-axis.
       <bold>  - end:</bold> aligns the grid container along the end edge of the cross-axis.
       <bold>  - center:</bold> centers the grid container along the cross-axis.
       <bold>  - space-between:</bold> evenly distributes the grid items along the cross-axis, with the first item at the start edge and the 
       last item at the end edge.
       <bold>  - space-around:</bold> evenly distributes the grid items along the cross-axis, with equal space between each item and half 
       that space at the start and end edges.
        <bold> - space-evenly:</bold> evenly distributes the grid items along the cross-axis, with equal space between each item and at the 
        start and end edges.

        <bold> -place-content</bold>
        The place-content property in CSS grid allows you to align and justify grid items along both the horizontal and vertical axes.
         Here is an example of how to use place-content:

        
         <bold> - grid-auto-columns & grid-auto-rows</bold>grid-auto-columns and grid-auto-rows are properties that allow you to define the
          size of rows and columns that are created automatically to fill the grid container. These properties come into play when there 
          are more grid items than cells in the explicit grid, which means that some cells are created automatically to accommodate the 
          additional items.

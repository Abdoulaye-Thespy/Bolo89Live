        <h2>Introduction To Git and Github</h2>
        <br>
        <p>In the past, developers used to write code and save it on their local machines. If they needed to
           share their source code or project, they would typically use an external USB drive. The process 
           involved transferring the code onto the USB drive, disconnecting it, and then connecting it to 
           the computer they wished to share the code or project with. However, this method had many setbacks
            and limitations.
            <br>
          Fortunately, as technology advanced, Git and GitHub were introduced to simplify and facilitate 
          this process.Git and GitHub emerged as solutions to simplify and enhance the process of sharing 
          code and collaborating on projects. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Git was developed in 2005, which allows developers to track changes, manage versions,
           and collaborate efficiently in a distributed version control system.
           This means that Git can track the state of different versions of your projects while 
           you're developing them. It is distributed because you can access your code files from 
           another computer â€“ and so can other developers.
           Git is open source because its source code is made freely available for anyone to modify and use,
            aside from its creator. Open-source projects are built and maintained collectively by 
            different developers in different locations.
            When you're building an open source project, you'll need a way to document or track your code.
             This helps make your work organized, and lets you keep track of the changes you've made. 
             This is what Git lets you do.
             Git also allows for non-linear development by allowing developers to work on different 
             branches of code simultaneously and merge them together when ready.
             <br>
             <br>
             <h3>Basic Git Commands  </h3>
             A Git command is a string of text that tells Git what to do. Each Git command does a different
              task, but they all work together to help developers manage their code changes.
              <br>
              Git is typically used through the command line. The Git command line interface (CLI) is a 
              tool for running these commands. The Git command line tool is installed by default on macOS and 
              Linux and can be easily installed on Windows.
              <br>
              <br>
              Once you have Git installed, you can clone an existing repository or create a new one. 
              To clone a repository, you will need the URL of the git repository. To create a new git 
              repository, use the git init command.
              Once you have a git repository, you can add files to it and commit changes.
               For instance, to add a file to a git repository, use the git add command. 
               To commit changes, use the git commit command.
               While Git is a powerful tool, it can be challenging to use if you're not familiar with 
               the command line. That's where GitHub comes in. In fact, GitHub is built on Git.
          </p>
  
          <p><bold class="grid-bold">Git Init:</bold>
            Initialize a new git repository. It is the first command you run when starting a new project.
          </p>
          <br>
  
          <p><bold class="grid-bold">Git Clone:</bold>
            Clone an existing git repository. This command allows you to create a local copy of a remote repository.
          </p>
          <br>
  
          <p><bold class="grid-bold">Git Add:</bold>
            Add files to a repository. This command allows you to add new files or changes to already 
            existing files to a git repository.
          </p>
          <br>
  
          <p><bold class="grid-bold">Git Commit:</bold>
            Make changes to a repository. This command saves your changes to the git history.
          </p>
          <br>
  
          <p><bold class="grid-bold">Git Push:</bold>
            Push changes to a git remote repository. This command pushes your local commits to a remote 
            git repository. ie(Github)
          </p>
          <br>
  
          <p><bold class="grid-bold">Git Pull:</bold>
            Pull changes from a git remote repository. This command pulls down any remote changes and 
            incorporates them into your local git repository.. ie(Github)
          </p>
          <br>
  
          <p><bold class="grid-bold">Git Status:</bold>
            Check the status of your git repository. This will let you know which files have been modified 
            and which files are being tracked by git
          </p>
          <br>
  
          <p><bold class="grid-bold">Git Log:</bold>
            View the commit history for your git repository. This is useful for finding out when 
            certain changes were made and who made them.
          </p>
          <br>
  
          <p><bold class="grid-bold">Git Reset:</bold>
            Reset your git repository to a specific commit. This command allows you to undo changes to
             a file or reset your git history
             <br>
             <br>
             Thus If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, itâ€™s considered committed. 
             If it has been modified and was added to the staging area, it is staged. 
             And if it was changed since it was checked out but has not been staged, it is modified.
          </p>
          <br>
  
          <p>
          while building your codes, you need a place to host your code (project) inorder to control 
          each version of your project easier and faster. This is where GitHub comes in.
          <br>
           GitHub provides a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories, making it easier for 
          developers to share, collaborate, and manage their code in a more streamlined and accessible manner.
          When you're using GitHub, you're working with Git beneath the hood.
          GitHub allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files or code. Any member of
           a team can access the GitHub repository (think of this as a folder for files) and see the most 
           recent version in real-time. Then, they can make edits or changes that the other collaborators 
           also see. GitHub also lets users make requests of one another and internally discuss the 
           iterations along the way. 
           <br>
           <br>
  
           GitHub offers both a paid and free subscription. With a free subscription, users can create 
           public repositories. Public repositories are visible to anyone and can be cloned or forked by 
           anyone. (A fork is a separate copy of the Git repository that was made. A clone, in contrast, 
           creates a linked copy that will continue to synchronize with the target repository.) 
           A paid subscription is required to create private repositories. Private repositories are only 
           visible to users who have been given access by the repository owner.
           <br>
           <br>
           GitHub offers features such as bug tracking, task management, and project management. In addition
            to Git repositories, GitHub also provides a platform for developers to share code snippets,
             issues, and documentation. Developers can also use GitHub to track the progress of their projects.
             <br>
             <br>
  
             Customizing your GitHub profile README helps you stand out from random GitHub users.
             The README.md file helps you describe your GitHub profile, and you can use it to show what
              you're currently learning, the projects you have built or worked on, along with your skills and 
              contributions. The GitHub README.md uses markdown to format its content. 
              It has an easy-to-learn syntax.
  
              <h3>Connect your GitHub account to your Git account.</h3>
              After git and Github has been downloaded on your computer, you can connect both of them by 
              following the methods below. You'll do this from your terminal:
              <ul>
                <li>To set your Git username, type this in your terminal:
                  <span class="grid-bold">git config --global user.name "your user name"</span>
                </li>
                <br>
  
                <li>To confirm that you have set your Git username correctly, type this:
                  <span class="grid-bold">git config --global user.name</span>
                  You should have "your user name" as the output.
                </li>
                <br>
  
                <li>To set your Git email, type this in your terminal:
                  <span class="grid-bold">git config --global user.email "youremail@gmail.com"</span>
                </li>
                <br>
  
                <li>To confirm that you have set your Git email correctly, type this:
                  <span class="grid-bold">git config --global user.email</span>
                  You should have "youremail@gmail.com" as the output.
                </li>
                <br>
  
                <li> To authenticate your GitHub account just sign in with the same email above to confirm.
                </li>
                <br>
  
                <li>Create a local git repository or repo, which is the Git version of a project folder.
                   Git will track any changes inside of a repository. Start by creating a directory on your
                    machine and cd or log into the directory you created.
                  <span class="grid-bold">mkdir your project name. eg mkdir myProject
                    <br>
                    cd your project name. eg cd myProject
                  </span>
                </li>
                <br>
  
                <li>Create a new file in your myProject directory named hello.txt
                 <span class="grid-bold">touch hello.txt</span>
               </li>
               <br>
  
               <li>The file is now in the directory, but Git wonâ€™t officially keep track of the changes of 
                the new file unless you explicitly tell it to by running the code:
                <span class="grid-bold">git add name of the file</span>
              </li>
              <br>
  
              <li>To check the status of the file if it is being tracked by git or not, you run:
                <span class="grid-bold">git status</span>
              </li>
              <br>
  
              <li>Once you have one or more changes to the staging area, you can commit them with a message using:
                <span class="grid-bold">git commit -m 'adds the hello.txt or any commit message'</span>
                The saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, 
                which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture
                 the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.
                 Committing cleans the status of the staging area:
              </li>
              <br>
  
              <li>Committing permanently stores the changes you made into a record store, or shows 
                the commit history. Which you can see by typing git log command:
                <span class="grid-bold"> git log</span>
              </li>
              <br>
  
              <li>To push the changes to github ,or to make the project accessible to other developers globally
                do :
                <span class="grid-bold"> git push</span>
              </li>
              <br>
              </ul>
  
           <h3>Why Is Version Control Important?</h3>
  
           Version control is important as it makes collaboration more transparent and reproducible.
           By visibly tracking iterative changes, you and your collaborators can experiment with new 
           approaches knowing that you can revert to the original as needed.
           <br>
  
           By using Git and GitHub, you can access your code from any computer. If your local machine was to
            get damaged or stolen, for example, you would lose all of your code with no way to retrieve it.
            However, if you store your code on GitHub, which is a cloud-based service, you never have to 
            worry about losing it.
            Git and GitHub are great tools to consider when working on any coding project.

      <h2>Grid: A Powerful Tool for Web Layout Design</h2>
      <p>In the world of web design, creating visually appealing and well-structured layouts is crucial. One effective 
        tool that has revolutionized the way websites are designed is the CSS grid. With its flexible and intuitive nature,
         the grid system provides designers with a powerful framework for arranging and organizing web page elements. 
         In this article, we will introduce the basics of grid and explore its importance along with some demonstrations.
         <br>
         
         CSS grid is a layout system that allows designers to create complex web page structures by dividing the layout
         into rows and columns. It provides a two-dimensional grid that enables precise control over the placement and 
         alignment of elements within a container. Also, it lets you create a grid-based structure for your web page, 
         making it easier to achieve responsive designs.

         <h3>Why is grid important?</h3>
         <br>
         <ul>
          <li>
            One of the key benefits of using a grid system is its ability to create responsive layouts. Grids provide a 
            flexible structure that automatically adapts to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring consistent and
             visually appealing designs across various platforms.</li>
             <br>

             <li>Grids help maintain consistency in design by providing a systematic framework. With grid-based layouts,
              designers can organize content elements in a harmonious and structured manner, making it easier for users 
              to navigate and understand the website's information hierarchy.</li>
              <br>

              <li> Designers can easily align and position elements on the grid, reducing the time spent on manual 
                adjustments. This efficiency allows designers to focus more on creativity and refining the overall user 
                experience.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Grids offer flexibility in terms of layout variations. Designers can experiment with different grid 
                  configurations to create unique and engaging designs.</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Some examples where grid is commonly used</h3>

          <li>Grids are commonly used in magazine-style designs where content is presented in a grid-like structure. 
            This allows for easy placement of articles, images, and other elements in a visually pleasing manner.</li>
            <br>

            <li>Grids provide an excellent foundation for creating portfolio websites. Designers can use the grid system
               to showcase their work in a clean and organized manner, making it easier for visitors to navigate through
                different projects.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Grids are ideal for displaying product listings in e-commerce websites. By using a grid, designers
                   can arrange product images, titles, prices, and other details in a consistent and visually appealing 
                   manner, enhancing the overall shopping experience.</li>
                   <br>

                   <li>Also, think of a webpage and how there's usually a navigation bar, a sidebar, and the content in 
                    the middle. A CSS Grid helps achieve that sort of styling easily by dividing up the page into 
                    different sections where each element can take place in the specified section.</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>key aspects of the grid concept </h2>
      </p>

      <p><bold class="grid-bold">Grid Container:</bold>
        In CSS Grid, a grid container is the parent element that contains a grid layout. It is defined using the 
        <span class="grid-span"> display: grid or display: inline-grid property </span> on the container element. Once a container element
         is defined as a grid container, you can use a variety of properties to control the layout of the grid.
         <br>

      </p>
      <br>

      <p><bold class="grid-bold">Grid item: </bold>
        The child elements of the grid container that are placed into the grid. Grid items are positioned using 
        grid lines, which are defined by the grid tracks.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="assets/img/blogs/second-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

      </p>
      <br>

      <p><bold class="grid-bold">Grid line: </bold>
        A line that divides the grid into rows or columns. Grid lines are numbered from 1 to n, where n is the number 
        of rows or columns in the grid.
        <br>

      </p>
      <br>

      <p><bold class="grid-bold">Grid track: </bold>
        The space between two adjacent grid lines. Grid tracks can be sized using the 
       <span class="grid-span"> grid-template-columns </span>  and <span class="grid-span"> grid-template-rows properties.</span> The space between
        two-row lines is referred to as the row tracks and The space between two-column lines is referred to as the column tracks. A size is 
        assigned to these tracks whenever a grid is created.

      <p><bold class="grid-bold">  Grid cell: </bold>
        The intersection of a row and a column in the grid. Grid cells can contain grid items or be empty.

      <h2> CSS Grid Properties </h2>
      
      <p>There are two main types of CSS Grid properties namely:
        <br>

        <bold class="grid-bold">Parent properties (Grid Container)</bold>  and <bold class="grid-bold">Child Properties (Grid Items).</bold>

        <h4> Parent properties (Grid Container) </h4>
        Grid Container properties are used to define the layout of the grid container itself. These properties are 
        applied to the parent element that contains the grid items. Some examples are:
        </p>
         
        <ul>

          <li> <bold class="grid-bold"> - Display:</bold> The display property is used to define the container element as a 
            grid container. To use the display with CSS Grid, set the value to grid. This will turn the container element into a grid 
            container, allowing you to use other grid properties to define the grid layout. </li>
            <br>

            <li> <bold class="grid-bold">- grid-template-columns & grid-template-rows: </bold> grid-template-columns and 
              grid-template-rows are used to define the size and position of columns and rows in a CSS grid. These properties 
              allow you to create a flexible and responsive grid layout that can adjust 
              to different screen sizes and content.
              <br>
              <br>
              <img src="assets/img/blogs/seventh-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
              <br>

              the values represent the track size, and the space between them is the grid line. We can then place elements inside the grid by using 
              the grid-column and grid-row properties.</li>
              <br>
              <li><bold class="grid-bold">- grid-template-areas: </bold> grid-template-areas allows you to define the layout of a grid by assigning 
                names to areas within the grid. These names are used in the grid-area property to place items within the grid.
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="assets/img/blogs/eight-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

              </li>
              <br>

              <li> <bold  class="grid-bold">- grid-template: </bold> grid-template is a shorthand property in CSS Grid that allows 
                you to define both the number and size of grid columns and rows in one declaration.
                
             </li>
             <br>

             <li> <bold  class="grid-bold"> -  column-gap, row-gap </bold> column-gap and row-gap define the space between columns and rows, respectively.
              We have a grid container with three columns and two rows.
              <br>
              <br>

             <br>

             <li><bold  class="grid-bold"> -grid-gap </bold> grid-gap is a shorthand property in CSS grid layout that allows you 
              to specify the gap between grid columns and rows at the same time.
              <br>
              <br>
              <img src="assets/img/blogs/ninth-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

            </li>
              <br>

              <li><bold  class="grid-bold"> - justify-items </bold> justify-items is a CSS Grid property that defines how the 
                grid items are aligned along the main axis (the horizontal axis) within their grid container. It is used to 
                control the positioning of items in the grid container when there is extra space available in the main-axis direction.
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="assets/img/blogs/tenth-pic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

                 <br>
                Here are the possible values for justify-items in CSS Grid:
                <br>
                <bold  class="grid-bold">- stretch (default):</bold> This value stretches the grid items to fill the

              <br>

              <li><bold  class="grid-bold"> - align-items </bold> align-items defines how the grid items are aligned along the cross-axis (the vertical axis) within 
                their grid container. It is used to control the positioning of items in the grid container when there is extra space available in
                 the cross-axis direction.

                <br>

                <li><bold class="grid-bold">-place-items</bold> 
                  place-items is a shorthand CSS Grid property that combines the align-items and justify-items properties into a single declaration. 
                  It is used to set both the horizontal and vertical alignment of grid items within their grid container.
                    The possible value for place-items in CSS Grid is:
                    <span class="grid-span"> <align-items> <justify-items>:</span> This value specifies the alignment for the vertical
                      and horizontal axes respectively. You can use any

      <h4> Child Properties (Grid Items) </h4>

      <p>
        Child properties are the CSS properties applied to the individual child elements of grid items. They are: grid-column-start, 
        grid-column-end, grid-row-start, and grid-row-end, Grid-column and grid-row, grid-area, justify-self, align-self, and place-self
        <br>
        <br>

        <bold class="grid-bold"> grid-column-start, grid-column-end, grid-row-start & grid-row-end</bold>
        <br>
        The properties grid-column-start, grid-column-end, grid-row-start, and grid-row-end are used to specify the location of a grid item 
        within the grid container.

        The grid-column-start and grid-column-end properties are used to specify the start and end positions of the grid item along the
         horizontal axis (columns). For example, the grid-column-start value of 1 and grid-column-end value of 3 for the .item-1 class 
         specifies that the grid item should start at column 1 and end at column 3. Similarly, the grid-row-start and grid-row-end properties 
         are used to specify the start and end positions of the grid item along the vertical axis (rows). For example, the grid-row-start 
         value of 1 and grid-row-end value of 2 for the .item-1 class specifies that the grid item should start at row 1 and end at row 2.

         <bold class="grid-bold">  grid-column & grid-row: </bold>
         <br>
         The grid-column and grid-row properties specify a grid item's location within a grid container. When using these properties on a 
         child grid item, you can define the starting and ending grid lines on the horizontal (for grid-column) and vertical (for grid-row) 
         axes to determine the position and size of the item in the grid. You can adjust the values of grid-column and grid-row to position 
         your grid items as desired within the grid container.

         <bold class="grid-bold"> grid-area: </bold> 
         
         The grid-area property is used to assign a grid item to a named grid area, specified by the grid-template-areas property 
         on the parent container.

         <br>

         To use grid-area, you need to follow these steps:
         <br>
         <br>
         Define the grid layout on the parent container using the grid-template-areas, grid-template-rows, and grid-template-columns properties.
         <br>
         <br>
         Assign a name to each grid area using the grid-area property on the child items. The name should correspond to the name you 
         defined in the grid-template-areas property.
         <br>
         <br>
         Set the position and size of the grid item using the grid-row-start, grid-row-end, grid-column-start, and grid-column-end properties.
         <br>
         <br>

         In this example, we have a container with a grid layout that defines three rows and two columns, and three named grid areas. 
         Each child item is assigned to a grid area using the grid-area property, and its position and size are set using the grid-row-start, 
         grid-row-end, grid-column-start, and grid-column-end properties.

          <p>
         <bold class="grid-bold"> justify-self, align-self & place-self: </bold> 
         The justify-self, align-self, and place-self properties are used to control the alignment and placement of grid items 
         within their grid cells. These properties are applied to individual grid items, rather than to the grid container as a whole.
         Here's a brief explanation of each property:
         <br>
         </p>
         
         <p>
         <bold class="grid-bold"> -justify-self:</bold> This property controls the horizontal alignment of a grid item 
         within its cell. It can take values like start, end, center, stretch, and auto.
          <br>
          </p>

          <p>
          <bold class="grid-bold"> -align-self:</bold> This property controls the vertical alignment of a grid item within its cell. It can take values like 
          start, end, center, stretch, and auto.
          <br>
          </p>

          <p>
          <bold class="grid-bold"> -place-self:</bold> This is a shorthand property that combines justify-self and align-self into a single declaration. 
          It takes two values, the first for horizontal alignment and the second for vertical alignment, separated by a space.
          <br>
          </p>

          <p>
          using display: flex, justify-content, and align-items. The justify-self, align-self, and place-self properties are then used
           to control the alignment of individual items within their cells. The first item is aligned to the start of its cell horizontally 
           using justify-self: start. The second item is aligned to the end of its cell vertically using align-self: end. The third item is 
           centered both horizontally and vertically using place-self: center stretch, which sets the horizontal alignment to center and the 
           vertical alignment to stretch.

      <h4> Tricks while using CSS Grids</h4>
      <p>To create more flexible and maintainable CSS grids, you can use these tricks to simplify your code.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Use the repeat() function to simplify grid templates: example; Instead of this <span class="grid-span"> grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;</span>
        Use the repeat() function for cleaner code <span class="grid-span"> grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        -  Use auto-fit or auto-fill to create flexible grids: example; This grid will automatically create as many columns as will fit in the container
        <span class="grid-span"> grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr)); </span> .  This grid will always create 3 columns, and will fill any extra space 
        with empty cells <span class="grid-span"> grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        -  Use grid-gap to add spacing between grid items: example; This grid will have a 20px gap between grid items  
        <span class="grid-span"> grid-gap: 20px;</span>
         <br>
         <br>
         -  Use grid-template-areas to create named grid areas
         <br>
         <br>
         - Creating a responsive grid with media queries
         <br>
         <br>
         - Nesting grids for more complex layouts
         <br>
         <br>

         To conclude, it is important to understand the basic principles of grids and practice working with them. Start by experimenting 
         with simple grid structures and gradually explore more complex layouts. Familiarize yourself with CSS grid systems and frameworks 
         that provide ready-to-use grid structures, making it easier to implement grids in your designs. Remember, the grid concept is a 
         powerful tool that can greatly enhance your web design skills. Embrace its structure, experiment with different layouts, and enjoy 
         the creative possibilities it offers.
